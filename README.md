# Mouse-Tab-Controller-using-open-CV


The Mouse Tab Controller using OpenCV project is a creative and highly practical implementation of computer vision technology that allows users to control mouse movements and interact with on-screen tabs simply through hand gestures captured via a webcam. Built with Python and OpenCV, the system tracks hand landmarks in real time and maps gestures to specific mouse functions such as moving the cursor, clicking, or switching between tabs, offering a completely touch-free interaction experience. This approach not only demonstrates the versatility of OpenCV in real-world applications but also opens the door to more accessible computing solutions, especially for users with physical limitations. By integrating gesture recognition with intuitive controls, the project transforms everyday interactions into a futuristic, contactless experience. Its lightweight design, smooth performance, and real-time response make it a perfect blend of AI-driven innovation and user convenience, showcasing how computer vision can be used to reimagine human-computer interaction.
